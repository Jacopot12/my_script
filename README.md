# General info
This is a just a raw repository of the scripts that I developed for my bioinformatics projects.

The most important are mypipelineMOA_1.0.sh, mypipelineMOA_2.0.sh, mypipelineMOA_1.2.sh and mypipelineMOA_1.3.sh.
Starting from these, I developed the MOAseq pipeline in Nextflow (see Nextflow_MOAseq folder).
However, the all the MOAseq pipeline present in Nextflow_MOAseq are just raw and specific to the project that requested them.

The final and general version of MOAseq pipeline (in Nextflow) is located in another repository that will remain private until publication.
