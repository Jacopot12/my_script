# General info
This is a just a raw repository for the scripts that I developed for my bioinformatics projects.

The most important are mypipelineMOA_1.0.sh, mypipelineMOA_2.0.sh, mypipelineMOA_1.2.sh and mypipelineMOA_1.3.sh.
Starting from these, I developed the MOAseq pipeline in Nextflow (see Nextflow_MOAseq folder).
However, the all the MOAseq pipeline present in Nextflow_MOAseq are raw and specific for the project that requested them.

The final and general version of MOAseq pipeline (in Nextflow), called MOAflow, is located in this repository: https://github.com/Jacopot12/MOAflow.git.
However, this repository will remain private until publication.
