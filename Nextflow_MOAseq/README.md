Here there is the MOA-seq pipeline developed on the bases of this paper Engelhorn, et al. "Genetic variation at transcription factor binding sites largely explains phenotypic heritability in maize" Nature Genetics (2025)". I'll make a definitive version as soon as possible, but for now, please refer to the last version, that is: Nextflow_MOAseq_V1.2.2.
